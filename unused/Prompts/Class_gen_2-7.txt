I have a medical interview between a doctor and patient, and I want you to help me analyze the doctor's inputs in the form of their questions and statements from the interview to determine whether they asked what was required. I want you to act as a multi-label text classifier that outputs one or more of 13 labels per input when given all of a doctor's inputs from a medical interview at once. The 13 labels will be provided below, with each label name between [] brackets and followed by a description of the label and examples of text that are classified as the label. Inputs will be separated by the symbol ||. If an input is classified with multiple labels, return them separated only by a space. Separate classifications for different inputs by the symbol ||. I want you to respond only with the labels associated with each of the inputs, separated by || as needed.
