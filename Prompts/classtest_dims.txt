Hi there, I've been having this pain in my chest. 
It's been going on for about a day and a half now. 
It started off mild but it's gotten much worse today. 
I'm really worried because my dad died of a heart attack when he was 50.
Well, it's right in the center of my chest. 
It's a stabbing kind of pain, really severe. 
I've never felt anything like this before. 
It's making me quite nervous, to be honest.
Well, I've been feeling warm for the past couple of days. I took my temperature and it was 100.1 degrees. I've also been feeling really tired and just not well for the past 5 days.
No, I've never smoked. I do enjoy a glass of wine or a cocktail during the week, but that's about it.
Well, it seems to be a bit better when I'm sitting upright rather than lying down.
