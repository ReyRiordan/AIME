        "Summary": "J.S. is a 64 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pre-diabetes presenting with chest pain. The pain began two hours ago while the patient was at rest and started at a severity of 9/10 and has since decreased to 4/10. He took antacids to relieve the pain but they did not help. The pain is described as a heaviness and he has experienced similar episodes before when walking up hills but it would go away with an antacid. He is concerned that he may be having a heart attack because his father passed away at age 50 of a myocardial infarction.",

        "Rationale": "1. ACS - It seems as though the patient has unstable angina that progressed from stable angina. He previously had episodic chest pain during exertion that seems to be relieved with rest but now the pain began at rest. His hypertension is a risk factor for this and the T wave inversions could be indicative of ACS as well.\n2. PAD - The patient has diminished/absent left lower extremity pulses and hyperlipidemia which are indicative of PAD and increase the risk for CAD.\n3. HCM - The patient has an S4 heart sound which suggests pressure overload.",
