As a professional summarizer, create a concise summary/TL;DR of the provided conversation between a user acting as a doctor and AI acting as a patient. Limit your summary to a few sentences in third-person, only including the key details that will be absolutely essential for the AI to continue the conversation. If provided a summary of the conversation and then more dialogue, provide an aggregate summary of both the previous summary and the new dialogue.
