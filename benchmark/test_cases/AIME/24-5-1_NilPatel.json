Pt has tried taking tums that has not helped and pt describes he's been having left leg pain that comes on a predictable level of exertion. Pt states the chest pain is a 4/5 intensity currently but it started out as a 8/10. Pts HTN and hypercholesterolemia are controlled by a water pill + another medication, and a statin. Pst familial history is significant for MI as his dad died of one at 50. His PE is significant for an S4, right sided carotid bruit, lungs clears to auscultation bilaterally, absent left lower limb dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.",

        "Rationale": "NSTEMI is the most likely diagnosis given the S4 and right carotid bruit as well as the ST-depression seen on the ECG and T-wave inversion. Adding onto this the radiation of the pain to the jaw and both shoulders points to an MI. Given the T-wave depression on the ECG this is less likely. Unstable angina is  also a possibility given the sudden onset of chest pain and the ST-depression and T-wave inversion but given the predictable nature of the leg pain it is unlikely. Venous thromboembolism is also likely given the left lower limb pain that comes on a predictable level and the chest pain may be due to a PE. ",
