This is the chat interface where you can interview your virtual patient. You may type your message to your patient in the text box at the bottom of your screen, and either press "Enter" or click the paper airplane button when your message is ready to be sent. The virtual patient should then respond to your message. Please treat this as a real medical interview, imagining that you have just walked into a room where this patient was waiting. Once you are done, click the "End Interview" button to move on to the next screen.
