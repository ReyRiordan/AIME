D- Differential diagnosis

Offers more than one relevant diagnostic possibility, committing to what is most likely and considering what is less likely or unlikely yet important to consider for the main chief complaint. If the chief complaint is a diagnosis or syndrome (e.g., acute on chronic systolic heart failure) then differential to rate may be around the differential for that exacerbation (e.g., medical non-compliance vs arrhythmia).

2: all 3 features present AND 2 or more diagnoses
    a) Mentions angina, cardiac chest pain, stable/unstable, ischemia, or coronary artery disease/CAD
    b) Mentions GERD, esophageal, reflux, acid, esophageal spasm, esophageal motility
    c) Statement of probability, lead(ing), likely, probable, worrisome, concerning
1: at least 2 feature present AND 2 or more diagnoses OR differential is implicitly stated (e.g., “cardiac”, “esophageal”) OR implicitly prioritized
0: 0-1 feature present OR 0 or 1 diagnosis mentioned


E- Explanation of lead diagnosis

Explains the reasoning behind the lead diagnosis, including the epidemiology and key features and how these compare with the patient’s presentation. If objective data points are not clearly linked to the lead diagnosis or alternative diagnosis, then only designate points to lead OR alternative diagnosis and NOT both.

2: at least 1 point from each of the two categories below AND explicitly linked to lead/(ing)/most likely/most probable diagnosis
    a) Epidemiology: Mention of risk factors (cardiac), hypertension, diabetes, age
    b) Key features: lack of response to PPI/pantoprazole; pressure; burning; associated; stable/unstable; intermittent, recurring, recurrent, episodic; atypical; exertional; chronic; worsening or more frequent; provoked/provoking, relieved/alleviated;
1: use of at least one of the terms above explicitly linked to lead/(ing)/most likely/most probable diagnosis
0: none of these words explicitly linked to leading diagnosis


A- Alternative diagnosis explained

Explains the reasoning behind alternative diagnoses, including the epidemiology and key features and how these compare with the patient’s presentation and alternative diagnosis. If objective data points are not clearly linked to the lead diagnosis or alternative diagnosis, then only designate points to lead OR alternative diagnosis and NOT both.

2: at least 2 terms from below, NOT explicitly linked to the lead/(ing)/most likely/most probable diagnosis, and not "double-counting" words used in "Explanation of lead diagnosis"
    a) Mention of risk factors; medication; pressure; burning; associated; stable/unstable; intermittent,recurring, recurrent, episodic; chronic; worsening or more frequent; provoked/provoking, relieved/alleviated
    b) Mention of pulmonary, lung (not pleuritic; breath/breathing/SOB; wheezing; cough)
    c) Mention of esophageal/gastrointestinal (nausea, cough, reflux, voice change, dysphagia, heartburn)
1: At least 1 of the words above, NOT explicitly linked to the lead/(ing)/most likely/most probable diagnosis, and not "double-counting" words used in "Explanation of lead diagnosis"
0: No additional words after accounting for score in "Explanation of lead diagnosis"
