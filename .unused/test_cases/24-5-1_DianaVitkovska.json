        "Summary": "This is a 50 y/o male with past medical history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, 19-pack-year smoking history, and pre-diabetes presenting with acute onset chest heaviness and pain radiating to his jaw and both shoulders. This 8/10 pain gradually came on 2 hours ago while he was sitting at his desk at work. It has since improved to 4-5/10. The patient tried taking Tums which provided no relief. He is very concerned about his heart health given that his father passed away from heart attack at age 50. On physical exam, the patient appears anxious and mildly uncomfortable. His BP is 168/94 mm Hg; HR is 86 per minute, RR is 14/minute and comfortable, BMI = 31.2 kg/m2, O2 saturation is 98% on room air. There is no jugular venous pressure elevation. A right carotid bruit is present. The lungs are resonant to percussion anteriorly and posteriorly. Vesicular breath sounds are present and equal to auscultation. On cardiac exam, a regular rate and rhythm are present; An S4 is present. The left popliteal pulse is 1+ and the left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable. The right LE pulses are all normal. There is no clubbing or edema on extremities. On EKG: 86 bpm. Regular sinus rhythm. Narrow QRS.\nST depressions in V2-V6. T wave inversions in lead I, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6. \n",

        "Rationale": "ASC: The patient's symptoms of acute onset chest heaviness and pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, especially with a significant history of smoking, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and presence of risk factors like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prediabetes are highly suggestive of ACS. The EKG findings of ST depressions in multiple leads (V2-V6) and T wave inversions (particularly in leads I, V1-V6) are concerning for NSTEMI. The presence of an S4 heart sound and carotid bruit may indicate underlying cardiac pathology and atherosclerosis, respectively. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) evidenced by absent pedal pulses further raises concern for widespread atherosclerosis.\n\nAortic dissection: The acute chest pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, along with the presence of a carotid bruit, raise suspicion for aortic pathology such as dissection. While the EKG findings are more suggestive of NSTEMI, aortic dissection can present with similar symptoms and may have associated findings such as an abnormal carotid bruit. Further imaging studies such as a CT angiogram or transthoracic echocardiogram would be necessary to definitively rule out this diagnosis.\n\nCoronary artery disease: the patient's risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) predispose him to both coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. The presence of absent pedal pulses suggests significant vascular disease affecting the lower extremities. The EKG findings of ischemia in multiple leads could be reflective of underlying widespread atherosclerosis affecting both coronary and peripheral arteries. Evaluation with ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement would be important for further assessment and management.\n\n",

            "There were no issues during my interview. I started the interview twice because I exited by accident. On my first try, when I introduced myself the AI instead of just introducing itself gave me the entire run down of why he was there, the kind of pain, his concern etc. On the second try, this didn't happen, and the AI gave me an appropriate amount of details with each question I asked. I am mentioning this because I don't know if this is done on purpose. In real life, patients give different amounts of information when answering questions, so the AI emulates that well. However, in med school we are trained to know what additional questions we need to ask to get all the information we need. So, if the AI gives too much information without us asking, some students might miss out on learning what questions they have to ask.\nOtherwise, this worked amazing. I did the voice interview and it interpreted everything I said very well. The overall feel was very natural, interactive, and engaging. "

            "Do you have any other suggestions or areas for improvement? This could include ideas for new features, feedback sections, etc.",
            "It would be great to be able to download the patient summary, differential diagnoses, and the rationale the user writes, not just the interview itself. I think this tool can be developed to have different settings for different levels of student proficiency. For example for starting first-year medical students, there could be a beginner setting in which they could have a checklist guide appear on the screen during the interview helping them navigate the questions they need to asked (the traditional OPQRSTU). Then, as student progress through the year and learn new parts of the patient exam, more level can be added. I think this is an absolutely wonderful tool for medical students and I would enjoy doing this much rather than tons of nonsensical assignments we need to do to practice our history taking. I think there is an incredible potential to develop this into a country-wide program for medical schools. Great work!"
        ],
        "question4": [
            "How helpful do you think practicing an interview would be in learning cardiovascular pathophisiology?",
            "This is an amazing resource, but I am not sure how well it will work for learning CV pathophysiology per se. I think this tool is great to learn how to interview a patient, how to write up a summary, come up with differentials and rationale. It can be very useful when the students are already well versed with the typical presentations of CV cases, understand the pertinent signs and symptoms, and know how to evaluate ECG. This usually happens near the end of the module before to the exam. Additionally, with the interview, differentials, and the rationals this assignment does take a fair amount of time, so I fear some students might not entirely follow through with it, especially since they can use tools like ChatGPT to help them write the differentials and rationals. If this is an assignment that is due for a grade, they might just do it because they have to and not fully benefit from it. That being said, I think this tool would be perfect for students to use during the physicanship module, when we are actively learning how to perform an interview and write up a note. Something that I think would work well to learn CV pathophysiology has to be much quicker in giving feedback. For example, the user reads a few sentences for the initial presentation. Then, can type in different questions directly like \"is there an S4?\", \"does the patient have axis deviation?\" etc. Then, once the student has collected some information, they can type in what they think is going on, and the AI can give them feedback with rationale. I think a tool like this would be very popular particularly to learn physiology as it would basically guide students working through a case (which we usually receive as a vignette on the exam). You might think \"well, there is already ChatPGT for this\", but the problem with ChatGPT is that not everyone knows how to give it the correct prompts to do this. If you try do do this with ChatGPT, it will often give too much information revealing what the answer is and that defeats the purpose. It also makes a fair bit of mistakes with regard to physiology. Sorry for the long read, but I think this is wonderful work! I would love to use this as a student in the future to practice interviewing, making differentials, and writing a note. "
