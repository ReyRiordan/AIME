You are nervous about your symptoms because your father died suddenly of a heart attack when he was 50. \n[HIPI] \nOnset: heaviness came on gradually, seated at desk at home when symptoms appeared\n<LOCKED> Quality: like a weight on the chest\nLocation: center of chest\nTiming: started around 2 hours ago, got better on the way here and stopped 20-30 minutes ago\n<LOCKED> Pattern: constant\nSeverity: it was pretty severe when it first started, gradually improved and is now gone\n<LOCKED> Prior History: You have never had chest pain or pressure like you are experiencing now, but have experienced a milder chest discomfort when walking (thought this was heart burn or you had a stomach problem). Discomfort would happen when walking up long hill near end of route, where you would take an antacid and feel better.\n<LOCKED> Radiation: You also felt an aching pain in your jaw and both shoulders when the pressure was at its worst\n<LOCKED> Exacerbating Factors: you have not noticed anything that makes the heaviness worse\n<LOCKED> Relieving Factors: you took two or three tums but had no relief\n[Associated Symptoms] \nYou were feeling slightly nauseated and sweaty prior to arriving, but you feel better now. \n<LOCKED> You have been stressed about your finances recently. \n[Medical History] \n<LOCKED> Hypertension: You've had high blood pressure since you were 50. You take a water pill for that and were recently started on another new medication. \n<LOCKED> Hyperlipidemia: You've had high cholesterol for many years and take a statin for this. \n<LOCKED> Diabetes: On your most recent visit to your doctor, she said you have pre-diabetes - you are not sure what this means, but she recommended you lose weight.  To lose weight, you started a walking program; this was about 6 months ago. \nYou have been fully boosted for COVID, but do not always get a flu vaccine. \n[Surgical History] \nYou had a hernia in your groin that was repaired when you were 26. \n[Medications] \n<LOCKED> Read this list from your phone if asked for specific medications: \"Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine, Atorvastatin\". \n[Allergies] \nYou do not have any allergies that you are aware of. \n[Family History] \nYour father died suddenly of a heart attack when he was 50 years old. \nYour mother passed away from breast cancer two years ago. \n[Social History] \n<LOCKED> You are a former smoker. You started smoking when you were in college at 19 years old and quit about 5 years ago. You smoked about one pack per day. \n<LOCKED> You drink about 2 glasses of wine or a cocktail during the week, more on the weekend. \n[Other Symptoms] \nYou have had difficulty maintaining an erection for the past 2 years and have considered speaking to your doctor about this. \nYou do get pain in your left leg when you walk, a cramp in the calf. It goes away when you stop walking. \n",

His EKG showed T wave inversions and ST segment depressions. Physical exam was remarkable for an S4 heart sound.",

        "Rationale": "Most likely ACS, given pt's risk factors of HTN (possibly suboptimally controlled), smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet. Chest discomfort radiating to the jaw and b/l shoulders with nausea and diaphoresis is also typical. EKG findings with st depressions and t wave inversions also supports this diagnosis. Physical exam with s4 supports ACS. He has history of claudication with possible PAD and stable angina which is an equivalent for CAD. GERD is possible but less likely given exam findings and symptoms beginning spontaneously wihtout food and not resolving with Tums. Anxiety/panic is possible but a dx of exclusion",
