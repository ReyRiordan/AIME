        "Summary": "Patient is a male with a past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and pre-diabetes and a family history of fatal heart attack presenting with chest heaviness that began 2 hours ago. Pain was a 8/10 and started while the patient was sitting at his desk and was accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, and jaw pain radiating to both shoulders. Patient states that he has experienced episodes like this in the past when exercising, but they have resolved, usually after taking an antacid. Patient also has been experiencing erectile dysfunction for the past 2 years and claims to have pain in his left calf when walking that subsides when he rests. Physical exam in notable for high blood pressure of 168/94 , normal lung findings, an S4 heart sound, and a 1+ left popliteal pulse. ECG shows regular rate and rhythm with diffuse ST depressions.",

            "Pulmonary embolism"
        ],
        "Rationale": "The differential for this patient is Unstable Angina, NSTEMI, and Pulmonary Embolism. Unstable angina is most likely because the patient had experienced exertional chest pain in the past which has developed into chest pain at rest. Additionally, the ECG shows diffuse ST depression which support the diagnosis. NSTEMI is also a possible disgnosis given the symptom and ECG, however unstable angina is more likely because the chest pain is recurring and worsening. Pulmonary embolism is on the differential because it could result in chest pain and could result from a DVT in the leg, however the patient's erectile dysfunction and leg pain are consistent with a peripheral artery disease, which would make coronary artery disease more likely.",
