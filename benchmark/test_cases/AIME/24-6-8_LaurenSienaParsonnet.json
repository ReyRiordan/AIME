You are nervous about your symptoms because your father died suddenly of a heart attack when he was 50. \n[History of Present Illness] \nOnset: heaviness came on gradually, seated at desk at home when symptoms appeared\n<LOCKED> Quality: like a weight on the chest\nLocation: center of chest\nTiming: started around 2 hours ago\n<LOCKED> Pattern: constant\nSeverity: it was pretty severe when it first started, gradually improved and the pressure is much better but it is still there\n<LOCKED> Prior History: You have never had chest pain or pressure like you are experiencing now, but have experienced a milder chest discomfort when walking (thought this was heart burn or you had a stomach problem). Discomfort would happen when walking up long hill near end of route, where you would take an antacid and feel better.\n<LOCKED> Radiation: You also felt an aching pain in your jaw and both shoulders when the pressure was at its worst\n<LOCKED> Exacerbating: you have not noticed anything that makes the heaviness worse\n<LOCKED> Relieving: you took two or three tums but had no relief\n[Associated Symptoms] \nYou were feeling slightly nauseated and sweaty prior to arriving, but you feel better now. \n<LOCKED> You have been stressed about your finances recently. \n[Medical History] \n<LOCKED> Hypertension: You've had high blood pressure since you were 50. You take a water pill for that and were recently started on another new medication. \n<LOCKED> Hyperlipidemia: You've had high cholesterol for many years and take a statin for this. \n<LOCKED> Diabetes: On your most recent visit to your doctor, she said you have pre-diabetes - you are not sure what this means, but she recommended you lose weight.  To lose weight, you started a walking program; this was about 6 months ago. \nYou have been fully boosted for COVID, but do not always get a flu vaccine. \n[Surgical History] \nYou had a hernia in your groin that was repaired when you were 26. \n[Medications] \n<LOCKED> Read this list from your phone if asked for specific medications: “Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine, Atorvastatin”. \n[Allergies] \nYou do not have any allergies that you are aware of. \n[Family History] \nYour father died suddenly of a heart attack when he was 50 years old. \nYour mother passed away from breast cancer two years ago. \n[Social History] \n<LOCKED> You are a former smoker. You started smoking when you were in college at 19 years old and quit about 5 years ago. You smoked about one pack per day. \n<LOCKED> You drink about 2 glasses of wine or a cocktail during the week, more on the weekend. \n[Other Symptoms] \nYou have had difficulty maintaining an erection for the past 2 years and have considered speaking to your doctor about this. \nYou do get pain in your left leg when you walk, a cramp in the calf. It goes away when you stop walking. \n",

        "Summary": "John Smith is a 64 y/o male pt with a hx of hypertension, prediabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, a 37 pack-year hx of smoking, and a famHx of MI presenting to the office with moderate chest pressure that started two hours ago. The discomfort started when the pt was seated, and was originally an 8 to 9 out of 10, but has now reduced to a 4 out of 10. The pt was started on a walking regiment six weeks ago by his physician, and reports that he experienced moderate chest discomfort when walking up hills, but that the discomfort was relieved with rest. Vital signs: Temp is 37o C; BP is 168/94 mm Hg; HR is 86 per minute. RR is 14/minute and comfortable. BMI = 31.2 kg/m2; O2 saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, pt is notable for S4 heart sound, R carotid bruit, 2+ L femoral pulse but 1+ L popliteal pulse and absent L dorsalis pedis and post tibial pulses. ECG is notable for ST depression in leads V2-V6.",

        ],
        "Rationale": "Pt has a history of chest discomfort upon exertion that is relieved with rest. Coupled with his history of hypertension, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia, this suggests that he has had stable angina. However, his stable angina has progressed at least to unstable angina, since this episode of chest discomfort occurred at rest, not during exertion. Based off of his ECG, however, it appears that the patient's angina has progressed to an NSTEMI. NSTEMI is most likely considering the presence of ST depression in leads V2-V6.",
