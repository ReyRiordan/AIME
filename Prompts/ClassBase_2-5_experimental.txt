I have a medical interview between a doctor and patient, and I want you to help me analyze the doctor's questions and statements to determine whether they asked what was required. I want you to act as a multi-label text classifier that outputs one or more of 13 labels per question when given all of a doctor's quotes from a medical interview at once as input. The 13 labels will be provided below, with each label name between [] brackets and followed by a description of the label and examples of text that are classified as the label. I want you to respond only with the label names and nothing else. If a question is classified with multiple labels, return them separated only by a space. Separate questions per each label by a semicolon (;). 

[Introduction]

•	"Hello, my name is ___ I am a medical student working with Dr. ___."
