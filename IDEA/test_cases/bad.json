    "Key Findings": "NO INPUT",
    "HPI": "60-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with a “pressure-like burning sensation” in the middle of her chest for the last 6 months that has been getting worse. A month ago, she was started on pantoprazole, but this didn't help, but Tums sometimes does. Episodes happen after eating or walking or when stressed. Worse when lying down and better when sitting up. Once or twice, it came on “out of nowhere”. Episodes last 5-10 minutes. Sometimes feels burning in the stomach also. Is sometimes sweaty and nauseous.",
    "Past Histories": "Past medical history: Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia\n\nPast surgical history: None\n\nFamily history: No known family history of heart disease. Mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 70.\n\nSocial History: Never smoker. Occasional glass of wine. Works as a high school teacher. Does not exercise regularly.\nMedications: Losartan, metformin, atorvastatin, Tums as needed.\n\nReview of systems:\nAll negative except what is in the HPI.",
    "Summary": "60-year-old female with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with “pressure-like burning sensation” in her chest for 6 months.",
    "Assessment": "Lead diagnosis - GERD\n\t- Episodes are described as “burning” in the chest.\n\t- Episodes are sometimes caused by eating and relieved by Tums.\n\nAlternative diagnoses:\n\t- Gastritis: Episodes are described as “burning” usually in the chest, but sometimes in her stomach.\n\t- Peptic ulcer disease: Same reason as above\n\t- Anxiety/panic attacks: Episodes can be triggered by stress. The patient also reports occasional sweating and nausea, which can be seen in panic attacks. Not as likely because “burning” usually is more likely in reflux.",
    "Plan": "GI consult and endoscopy"
