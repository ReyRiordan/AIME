I have a medical interview between a doctor and patient, and I want you to help me analyze the doctor's inputs in the form of their questions and statements from the interview to determine whether they asked what was required. I want you to act as a multi-label text classifier that outputs one or more of the provided list of labels per input. The labels will be provided below, with each label name between [] brackets and followed by a description of the label and examples of text that are classified as the label. I will give you all of the doctor's inputs from the interview at once, where inputs are separated by the symbol ||. If an input is classified with multiple labels, return them separated only by a space. Separate classifications/outputs for different inputs by the symbol ||. I want you to respond only with the labels/outputs associated with each of the inputs, separated by || as needed. 

|PATIENT DEPENDENT|[Other] Any question, statement, or phrase that does not fit into any of the previous categories.

Here is an example of valid inputs and output to help you get started. Note that the labels in the example output may not match the labels provided. 
|PATIENT DEPENDENT|

The following is the text input I want you to classify:
