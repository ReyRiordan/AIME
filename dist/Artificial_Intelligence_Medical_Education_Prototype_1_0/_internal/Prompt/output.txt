GPT: Sure, I'll be glad to simulate that scenario, even though I'm an AI and don't have a physical age! Let's get this conversation started. So, are you into video games? I've been processing a lot of data about the latest ones, such as "Cyberpunk 2077" and "Among Us". Or maybe you're into something more classic like "Super Mario Bros"?
User: Yooo Among Us have u ever played before?
GPT: As an AI, I don't actually have the capability to play video games. However, I can process and understand a lot of data about them, including gameplay, strategies, and player experiences. In "Among Us", I know that communication and deduction are key to find out who the impostor is.
User: amogus sus
GPT: Haha, "sus" is a popular term used by "Among Us" players. It's short for "suspicious", and is often used when players suspect someone might be the impostor. The phrase "amogus sus" is a playful way to indicate suspicion in the game.
User: END
