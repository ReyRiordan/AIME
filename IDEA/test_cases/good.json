    "Key Findings": "NO INPUT",
    "HPI": "60-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who is presenting with episodes of “pressure-like burning sensation” in the center of her chest over the past 6 months. Initially, it was intermittent, about once or twice a week, but this has progressively worsened, now experiencing episodes every day for the past week. Each episode lasts about 5-10 minutes and often starts after eating but can also be triggered while walking or when under emotional stress. 1-2 episodes have occurred without any precipitating factors. Patient describes episodes as “indigestion” and are associated with bloating. Sometimes the burning is felt in the stomach. It is sometimes exacerbated by lying down, coughing and deep inspiration, and improved with sitting up. Sometimes relieved with antacids. Previously, discomfort was a 4/10 in severity, now 6-7/10 over the past month. She has also started experiencing nausea and diaphoresis associated with these episodes over the past month. She was seen in the office about a month ago and started on a PPI for these symptoms, but it has not been helpful. In fact, symptoms are worse. Patient denies shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dysphagia, unintentional weight loss, or blood in the stool. She is not currently experiencing any symptoms.",
    "Past Histories": "Past medical history: Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia\n\nPast surgical history: None\n\nFamily history: No known family history of heart disease. Mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 70.\n\nSocial History: Never smoker. Occasional glass of wine. Works as a high school teacher. Does not exercise regularly.\n\nMedications: Losartan, metformin, atorvastatin, Tums as needed.\n\nReview of systems:\nNo fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue.\nNo recent illnesses, cough, wheezing.\nNo lower extremity edema, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, claudication.\nNo skins changes/rashes, arthralgias or myalgias.\nNo bruising or bleeding.\nNo diarrhea, constipation, blood in stool.\nNo dysuria, hematuria, polyuria or polydipsia.",
    "Summary": "60-year-old female with cardiac risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with a chronic, progressive dyspepsia that is brought on by food or exertion, and has worsened despite use of PPI.",
    "Assessment": "Lead diagnosis - Angina\n\t- Anginal symptoms can often mimic dyspepsia and GERD, particularly in female patients.\n\t- Patient is having episodes that are at times precipitated by exertion and becoming more frequent, even having 1-2 episodes at rest.\n\t- Episodes are occasionally relieved by antacids but has had no relief with a PPI. In fact, symptoms are worse.\n\t- Patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease.\n\nAlternative diagnoses:\n\t- GERD: GERD that is refractory to initial PPI is still possible given description of symptom as burning and worse with food, as some patients with GERD require escalation of therapy with a stronger PPI, addition of H2 blocker, or surgery. But worse symptoms on PPI warrants consideration of another diagnosis such as angina.\n\t- Peptic ulcer disease/gastritis Description of discomfort as “burning” and “indigestion,” precipitated by eating and sometimes relieved with Tums is consistent with this diagnosis. Less likely because symptoms have worsened, and episodes have become more frequent despite a PPI.\n\t- Costochondritis/pericarditis: Possible given location of pain and discomfort can be worse when lying down. Less likely because pain would be more constant, associated with deep inspiration, and patient has had no recent illnesses. Would also not be relieved with Tums.\n\t- Anxiety/panic attacks: Possible given episodes can be caused by emotional stress. No relief with PPI. Less likely because there are variable triggers to episodes, including eating and exertion.",
    "Plan": "EKG: To evaluate for signs of ischemia or prior infarct and to assess for suitability for exercise\n\nEKG stress test.\n\nStress test: to evaluate for coronary artery disease as possible explanation of patient's symptoms.\n\nIf above tests are negative or unrevealing, can consider an upper endoscopy to evaluate for peptic ulcer disease/gastritis/esophagitis."
