You are nervous about your symptoms because your father died suddenly of a heart attack when he was 50. \n[HIPI] \nOnset: heaviness came on gradually, seated at desk at home when symptoms appeared\n<LOCKED> Quality: like a weight on the chest\nLocation: center of chest\nTiming: started around 2 hours ago, got better on the way here and stopped 20-30 minutes ago\n<LOCKED> Pattern: constant\nSeverity: it was pretty severe when it first started, gradually improved and is now gone\n<LOCKED> Prior History: You have never had chest pain or pressure like you are experiencing now, but have experienced a milder chest discomfort when walking (thought this was heart burn or you had a stomach problem). Discomfort would happen when walking up long hill near end of route, where you would take an antacid and feel better.\n<LOCKED> Radiation: You also felt an aching pain in your jaw and both shoulders when the pressure was at its worst\n<LOCKED> Exacerbating Factors: you have not noticed anything that makes the heaviness worse\n<LOCKED> Relieving Factors: you took two or three tums but had no relief\n[Associated Symptoms] \nYou were feeling slightly nauseated and sweaty prior to arriving, but you feel better now. \n<LOCKED> You have been stressed about your finances recently. \n[Medical History] \n<LOCKED> Hypertension: You've had high blood pressure since you were 50. You take a water pill for that and were recently started on another new medication. \n<LOCKED> Hyperlipidemia: You've had high cholesterol for many years and take a statin for this. \n<LOCKED> Diabetes: On your most recent visit to your doctor, she said you have pre-diabetes - you are not sure what this means, but she recommended you lose weight.  To lose weight, you started a walking program; this was about 6 months ago. \nYou have been fully boosted for COVID, but do not always get a flu vaccine. \n[Surgical History] \nYou had a hernia in your groin that was repaired when you were 26. \n[Medications] \n<LOCKED> Read this list from your phone if asked for specific medications: \"Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine, Atorvastatin\". \n[Allergies] \nYou do not have any allergies that you are aware of. \n[Family History] \nYour father died suddenly of a heart attack when he was 50 years old. \nYour mother passed away from breast cancer two years ago. \n[Social History] \n<LOCKED> You are a former smoker. You started smoking when you were in college at 19 years old and quit about 5 years ago. You smoked about one pack per day. \n<LOCKED> You drink about 2 glasses of wine or a cocktail during the week, more on the weekend. \n[Other Symptoms] \nYou have had difficulty maintaining an erection for the past 2 years and have considered speaking to your doctor about this. \nYou do get pain in your left leg when you walk, a cramp in the calf. It goes away when you stop walking. \n",
