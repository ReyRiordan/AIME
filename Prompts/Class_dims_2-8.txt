I have a medical interview between a doctor and patient, and I want you to help me analyze the patient's responses to determine what dimensions of their main concern/symptom they mentioned. I want you to act as a multi-label text classifier that outputs one or more of 11 labels when given all of a patient's responses from a medical interview at once as input. The 13 labels will be provided below, with each label name between [] brackets and followed by a description of the label and examples of text that are classified as the label. Responses will be separated by the symbol ||. If a response is classified with multiple labels, return them separated only by a space. Separate classifications for different responses by the symbol ||. I want you to respond only with the labels associated with each of the responses, separated by || as needed.

[Onset]
Responses about how the symptom appeared (severity, all of a sudden or gradually, etc) and what they were doing when it came on.
•	"The pain came on all of a sudden."
•	"I was seated at home when it appeared."
[Quality]
Responses about the quality/sensation of the symptom, describing what it feels like.
•	"It's a sharp and stabbing pain in my chest."
[Location]
Responses about the location of the symptom.
•	"It's right in the center of my chest."
[Timing]
Responses about when the symptom started, how long it's been going on, or the duration of the symptom.
•	"It started around 2 hours ago."
[Pattern]
Responses about whether their symptom is constant or coming and going.
•	"The chest pressure is constant."
[Exacerbating]
Responses about what makes the symptom worse.
•	"The pain flares up when I take deep breaths."
[Relieving]
Responses about what makes the symptom better or more bearable
•	"It's more tolerable when I lie down."
[Prior_History]
Responses about whether the patient has ever had a similar symptom or concern before.
•	"No, I've never felt anything like this."
[Radiation]
Responses about other areas that the main symptom may have spread to.
•	"When the pain was at its worst, I also felt an aching in my jaw and shoulders."
[Severity]
Responses about how severe the symptom was, often on a scale from 1 to 10.
•	"I'd say it had a severity of 9 out of 10 when it first started, but it's a 5 now."
[Other]
Any question, statement, or phrase that does not fit into any of the previous categories. This can include responses about associated symptoms, risk factors, family or medical history, medications or allergies, etc.
•	"I'm also feeling nauseous and dizzy."
•	"I do have high blood pressure and take medication for it."
•	"I used to smoke in college."

Here is an example of valid input and output to help you get started.
Input: "Hi, I'm John Smith and I'm 64 years old.||I'm having this pressure in my chest, it started yesterday and it's right in the center of my chest.||My feet have also been swelling up a bit.||The pain gets worse when I walk around.||I've also noticed some pain in my shoulders.||I've felt something similar in the past when I was lifting weights."
Output: "Other||Timing Location||Other||Exacerbating||Radiation||Prior_History"

The following is the text input I want you to classify:
